# Simple-Sales-Dashboard-Design_Task-8
Interactive Power BI dashboard on Superstore data showing sales performance by product, region, and month with KPIs, trends, and insights.
In this task, I created a basic interactive dashboard using the Superstore dataset to analyze sales performance by product, region, and month.

First, I cleaned the dataset in Python (handled encoding, removed duplicates, converted dates, and added a Month-Year column).

Then I imported the cleaned data into Power BI, fixed data types, and created DAX measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin %.

**The dashboard design included:**

KPI Cards for quick metrics.

Line chart showing monthly sales trends.

Bar chart comparing sales across regions.

Donut chart showing sales share by product category.

Slicer for region to make the dashboard interactive.

Finally, I exported the dashboard and summarized insights.

**Key Insights:**

West region recorded the highest sales overall.

Technology category contributed the largest share of revenue.

December showed a clear sales peak, highlighting seasonality.

Profit margin was strongest in Technology compared to other categories.

This task helped me practice data cleaning, dashboard design, and insight communication.
